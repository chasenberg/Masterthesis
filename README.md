Preliminary studies of the blinded measurement of the CP-parameter sin(2beta).
==========================================================================

The steps of this analysis are as follows:
-----------------------------------------------

1. Apply sanity cuts and check trigger-efficiencies
    * Trigger-efficiency of combination ist approx 80%
2. Training of BDT to separate signal from background 
3. Determine decay-time acceptance and time resolution of the detector
4. Blinded decay-time fit
